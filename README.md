##### In this Project I created a PyChain Ledger and web based viewer using Streamlit.
I created and defined classes which included;
- Record - for held sender, receiver and ammount information
- Block - which contained information such as creator_id, previous_hash, timestamp, nonce
- PyChain - which provided the functionality for "Proof of work", adding blocks and confirming block were valid to be added the the ledger.

##### The streamlit Block explorer was awesome and included the following functionality:
- Block difficulty slider
- Block Inspector
- The ability to add tranactions to the ledger.
- The PyChain Ledger table for viewing records on the Ledger.
